lab_6 deals with controlling status of 5 LEDs with switch case

Contents for lab file series:(Lab_01 to Lab_10);
1. Make running light pattern of 5 LEDs. It should run in both the directions continuously.
2. Make experiment 1 work with two switches. One switch press would result running of
LEDs in one direction, while the second switch press would result running of LEDs in
opposite direction.
3. Make a light intensity meter that represent light intensity on 5 LEDs, such that all LEDs
would glow for maximum light, no LED would glow for dark condition, and likewise for
in between light intensities.
4. Fade and brighten 5 LEDs alternatively.
5. Make a street light controller.
6. Design a 4-bit counter.
7. Blink an LED with two switches. One switch for increasing the blinking rate and other
for decreasing the blinking rate.
8. Turn ON/OFF five LEDs individually via serial monitor window.
9. Lit an LED with brightness equal to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% via serial monitor
window.
10. Blink an LED in accordance with the brightness. Blinking frequency increases with
increase in brightness.
